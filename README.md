A web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user input, built with Node.js. This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning predictions into a web app, making healthcare analytics accessible to users.

## Features

- Predicts diabetes risk based on user input
- User-friendly web interface
- Built with Node.js and Express.js
- Integrates a machine learning model for predictions
- Clear and simple result display
